The fundamental tradeoffs are\nthe prices and bandwidths of RAMs and disks. The analysis indicates that with\ntoday's technology, five minutes is a good lifetime for randomly accessed\npages, one minute is a good lifetime for two-pass sequentially accessed pages,\nand 16 KB is a good size for index pages. These rules-of-thumb change in\npredictable ways as technology ratios change. They also motivate the importance\nof the new Kaps, Maps, Scans, and $/Kaps, $/Maps, $/TBscan metrics.\n", 'pdf_url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809005v1.pdf'}, {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9809023v2', 'updated': '1998-09-18T19:04:42Z', 'published': '1998-09-17T14:41:07Z', 'title': 'Similarity-Based Queries for Time Series Data', 'summary': '  We study a set of linear transformations on the Fourier series representation\nof a sequence that can be used as the basis for similarity queries on\ntime-series data. We show that our set of transformations is rich enough to\nformulate operations such as moving average and time warping. We present a\nquery processing algorithm that uses the underlying R-tree index of a\nmultidimensional data set to answer similarity queries efficiently. Our\nexperiments show that the performance of this algorithm is competitive to that\nof processing ordinary (exact match) queries us

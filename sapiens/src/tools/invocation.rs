        ## Observations:
        - The task involves finding lights in an office and setting their color like a rainbow.
        - We do not know what type of lights are in the office.
        - We do not know what kind of devices can be used to change the color of the lights.
        - We do not know the layout of the office.
        ## Orientation:
        - We need to find out the types of lights in the office.
        - We need to find the devices which can be used to control the color of the lights.
        - We need to decide the method to set the colors like a rainbow.
        - We need to provide the output of our action to Conclude Tool.
        ## Decision:
        - Use a search engine to look for information regarding the types of lights available in an office.
        - Search for devices that can be used for changing the color of these lights.
        - Research on how to set colors like a rainbow on these devices or lights.
        - Based on research, decide the method to control the light colors.

          - title: What Type of Light Bulbs Are Used in Office Buildings?
              Link: www.builddirect.com
              Snippet: There are a variety of lights used in office buildings, and that's actually
              a good thing. Different types of lights serve various purposes in the same
              space. From general flood lighting to task-specific lamps or bulbs, the
              assortment of fixtures offers lots of options for facility planners.
